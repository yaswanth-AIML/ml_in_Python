# KNN Classifier in Python 🧑‍💻

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **k‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using Python.  
KNN is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.  
In this repository, I’ve applied KNN to [your dataset name here, e.g., Iris dataset / custom dataset] to showcase how the algorithm works in practice.

## ⚙️ Features
- Implementation of KNN from scratch (without relying solely on scikit‑learn).
- Comparison with scikit‑learn’s built‑in KNN classifier.
- Data preprocessing and normalization for better accuracy.
- Visualization of decision boundaries and classification results.
- Easy‑to‑understand code with comments for learning purposes.
